Parametric algorithms are based on a mathematical model that defines the relationship between inputs and outputs. 

More restrictive than non-parametric algorithms, but faster and easier to train.

Parametric algorithms are most appropriate for problems where the input data is well-defined and predictable. 

# Non-parametric algorithms

Not based on a mathematical model, they learn from the data itself. 

Flexible than parametric algorithms but more computationally expensive. 

Non-parametric algorithms are most appropriate for problems where the input data is not well-defined or is too complex to be modelled using a parametric algorithm. 

Non-parametric algorithms are often more accurate than parametric algorithms for complex problems. 

# Examples
**Stock price prediction** - use parametric algorithm. Because input data is well defined and predictable. 

**Image classification** - use non-parametric algorithm, because the input data is not well-defined and too complex to be modelled using a parametric algorithm
