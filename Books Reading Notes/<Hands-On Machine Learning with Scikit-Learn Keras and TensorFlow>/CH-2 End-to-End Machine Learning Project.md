# Look at the Big Picture
[[Machine Learning Project Checklist]]

## Frame the Problem
- What exactly the business objective is? 
- How does the company use and benefit from this model?
- [[Data Pipeline]]

## Select a performance measure
- [[Root Mean Square Error]] (RMSE)
- [[Mean Absolute Error]] (MAE)
- The higher the norm index, the more it focus on large vales and neglect small ones
- RMSE is more sensitive to outliers than MAE (To test)

## Check Assumptions
- List and verify the assumptions that have been made
- E.g. after the price been calculated, will it be feed in to another algorithm as classes or real numbers?
