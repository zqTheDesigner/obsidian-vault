>Labels are the Target Variable or the Desired Solution

# What is Supervised Learning

The training set you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solution (Labels)

The labels here is the 'supervisor'.

When we have a target variable (Label) to predict based on a given set of predictors or independent variables. 

Use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from input variables (The predictor) (X) and output variable  (The label / target value) (y) 
`y = f(X)`
The goal is to approximate the real underlying mapping so well that when you have new input data (X), you can predict the output variables (y) for that data


Supervised learning is the foundation of all predictive modeling machine learning algorithms. ([[Time Series Forecasting as Supervised learning]])

Supervised learning problems can be further grouped in to [[Regression|regression]] and [[Classification|classification]] problems
