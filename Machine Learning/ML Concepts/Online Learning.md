- Learn incrementally
- Capable of adapting rapidly to both chancing data ad autonomous systems.
- Can be trained with very large quantities of data

# Out-of-core algorithms
- Handle vase quantities of data that cannot fit in a computer's main memory
- Chops the data into mini-batches and uses online learning techniques to learn from these mini batches
