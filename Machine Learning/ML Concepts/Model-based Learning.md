- Build a model of these examples and then use that model to make prediction.

## Process
- Study the data
- Select a model
- Train the model on the training data
- Apply the model to make predictions 

## Model selection


## Define the parameter value with a performance measure

#### Utility function - Measure how good the model performs

#### Cost function - Measure how bad the model performs
- For [[Linear Regression]] use a cost function that measures the distance between the linear model's prediction and the training examples (to minimize the distance)
