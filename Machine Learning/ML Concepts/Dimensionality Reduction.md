Simplify the data without loosing too much information. 

Merge several correlated features into one. 

> Example: car's age and mileage may strongly correlated. They can be merged to represents the car's wear and tear. 

It is often a good idea to try to reduce the dimension of your training data using a dimensionality reduction algorithm before you feed it to another Machine Learning algorithm.
