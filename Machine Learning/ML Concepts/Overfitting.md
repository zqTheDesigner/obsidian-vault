When the model does well with the original data, but doesn't do well with any other data set. 

- When a model fits the training data perfectly, it probably it is overfit and will not perform well with new data. (no Bias, but potentially large Variance)
- When training error is low but testing error (generalization error) is high

# Solutions
- Getting more data
- Simplifying the model (selecting a simpler algorithm, reducing the number or parameters or features used, [[Regularizing]] the model)
- Reduce the noise in the training data
