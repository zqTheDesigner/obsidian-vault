- Machine learning is all about make [[predictions|predictions]] and [[Classification|classifications]]


- Original data is called training data
- Use training data to build models
- Use testing data to measure the performance (evaluate) of the models built from training data

- [[Bias-Variance Tradeoff]] - Fitting the Training Data well but making poor predictions
