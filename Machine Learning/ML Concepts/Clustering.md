[[K-Means Clustering]]

Clustering, or Cluster analysis is a technique that allows us to find groups of similar objects. 

# Prototype-based clustering

Each cluster is represented by a prototype, which can either be the [[Clustering#Centroid|centroid]] (average) of similar points or [[Clustering#Medoid|medoid]] (the most representative or most frequently occurring point).

## Centroid

## Medoid
