A range of values that is used to estimate an unknown population parameter with a certain level of confidence.

If the same sample is taken multiple times, and a 95% confidence interval is calculated for each sample, then approximately 95% of the intervals would contain the true population parameter.

Use the sample mean and sample standard deviation to estimate the population mean and population standard deviation. The formula for a 95% confidence interval for the population mean is: 
(sample mean) Â± (critical value) * (standard error)

A 95% Confidence interval is a range of values that's likely to contain the true population parameter with a probability of 95%.
