- Rows in a Confusion Matrix Correspond to what the machine learning algorithm predicted
- Columns correspond to the known truth

- The size of the confusion matrix is determined by the number of things we want to predict
- A confusion matrix tell you what your machine learning algorithms did right and wrong
