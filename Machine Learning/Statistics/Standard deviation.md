- How dispersed the values are.

- Denoted as $\sigma$ (Greek letter sigma) 
- Square root of the [[Variance]] (which is the average of the squared deviation from the mean)

# Gaussian distribution 
- When a feature has a bell-shaped normal distribution
- '68-95-99.7' rule, 68% of value fall within 1 $\sigma$ of the mean, 95% falls within 2 $\sigma$ , and 99.7% falls within 3 $\sigma$
