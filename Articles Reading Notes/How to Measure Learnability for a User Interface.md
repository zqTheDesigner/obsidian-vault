# [[Five quality components of usability]]
- Learnability
- Efficiency
- Memorability
- Errors
- Satisfaction

# Learnability
How quickly users can acclimate to your interface

Learnability considers how easy it is for user to accomplish a task the first time they encounter the interface, and how many repetitions it takes for them to become efficient at that task.

# Learnability vs Efficiency
- **First-use learnability**: How easy it is to use the design the first time your try?
- **Steepness of the learning curve**: How quickly do people get better with repeated user of the design? If people feel that they are progressing and getting better and better at using your system.
- **Efficiency of ultimate plateau**: How high is the productivity that users can reach with this interface, important for people with a frequent and long lasting need to use the system. 

> A learnable system is not always efficient.

High learnability contributes to usability, quick system on-boarding , low training costs. 

# Running Learnability Study

Use quantitative usability testing. 

1. Determine the Metric
	- Time on task 
	- Consider collecting the number of errors users make for a given task
2. Determine the number of trails
	- To have some participants complete the same task multiple times
	- Repeat the trials until a plateau is reached
3. Gather and plot the data
	- Random the tasks to avoid biasing
	- Users learns from one task and apply the knowledge to another task
4. Analyze the curve
