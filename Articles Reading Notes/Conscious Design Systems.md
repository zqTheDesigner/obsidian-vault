# What is a design system
We create design systems by curating and distributing a collection of #components, #patterns and #content.

A good design system helps its users make informed, conscious choices about when and when not to use components. 

# Common Promises About Design Systems
## Efficiency
A design system will reduce waste in your design and development processes and help you go faster.

Efficiency is only valuable if it helps us move faster towards meaningful outcomes for the people using our products and services. 

## Consistency 
A design system will help you standardise your digital experiences.

Consistency is only valuable if we standardise things to a good level of quality.

## Scale
A design system will help you scale your design decisions across your product landscape.

Scaling things is only valuable if they are actually worth reproducing. 

# How design systems create value

There is no inherent value in the added capability promised by design system, the value must lie in what we do with it. 

It is not inherently valuable, it is also not inherently harmless. 

# The risk of design systems
Design system can also :
- Speed up problematic work
- Standardise things to a poorly quality 
- Scale things we don't want to reproduce

The mechanisms our design systems use to scale have no inherent value unless they're things we actually want to scale. 


# Our design systems are not just harmless scaling machines
#human-centred-design
When we don't design for this full human spectrum of identities and characteristics and circumstances and experiences that our design system needs to serve, we're not just excluding people, we're erasing them. 


# How to create Conscious design systems

1. Don't assume that common practice is not good practice
	Don't underestimate the power of [[Bandwagon Effect]].
2. Prioritise inclusion at every level
	The knowledge and experiences that get fed into our design systems :
	 **Explicit knowledge** (articulate, can easily be transferred)
	 **Tacit knowledge**(Difficult to transfer to another person by writing it down)
	 Tacit knowledge is acquired through lived experiences - and it't this that enables us to propagate inclusivity through our systems.
3. Create strong feedback loops
4. Create stress cases
	Prioritise stress cases, refer to book [[<Design for Real Life>]]

# Building a conscious design system will slow you down - do it anyway.
